# Document management
Even with more and more (electronic) paper coming in, I was initially skeptical whether I need a document management: I actually was happy with sorting pdfs into a folder structure. I had to try [paperless-ngx](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/) to understand how much faster (especially searching and checking documents) and easier it is.

I especially like that:
1. The documents are stored in the file system - and are also available if paperless-ngx is not running or in case it should be discontinued.
2. It "learns" which correspondent, document type and tags to assign to new documents.

## Installation

> [!hint] PostgreSQL
> I strongly recommend using PostgreSQL as a database. With SQLite the performance starts to degrade when a few hundred documents have been added.

1. Install a [Container engine](container-engine.md)
2. Create the folder `paperless-ngx` with the subfolders:
	1. `consume` (documents placed in this folder will be consumed by paperless-ngx)
	2. `data` (logs and the classification model)
	3. `export` (exports and database backups)
	4. `media`: (documents)
3. Download [these files](https://github.com/andju/docker-solutions/tree/main/paperless-ngx)  into the folder `paperless-ngx`
	1. Alternatively you can download the files from the [original source](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/tree/main/docker/compose)
4. Change the configuration in `docker-compose.env`:
	1. Remove the leading `#` in front of `PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY` and replace `change-me` with a series of random characters (you don't have to remember them)
	2. If you are running paperless-ngx on Windows (WSL2) the automatic detection of new files in the `consume` folder might not work. Configure a regular polling (e.g. every 60 seconds) by adding the following line to `docker-compose.env`:  `PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_POLLING=60`.
5. Run the following command in the folder `paperless-ngx`:
	1. `podman compose pull`
	2. `podman compose up -d`
6. Open http://localhost:8000

## Configuration and usage

I recommend the following OCR Settings:
	1. Output Type: `pdfa`
	2. Language: `deu+eng`
	3. Deskew: Experiment with this setting - for some documents it improves the quality, other are skewed a bit more.

To get started, copy a document into the folder `consume`. It will be added to the document management and you can edit the metadata in the browser.

You can find further advice in this [this article üá©üá™](https://itv4.de/paperless-ngx-mithilfe-von-docker-unter-windows-installieren/#Kurze_Einfuehrung_in_Paperless-ngx) .

## Features
Configure advanced features to make document handling and usage even simpler.
### Document splitting
If your scanner has an automatic document feeder (ADF) to scan multiple pages at once, you can scan multiple pages and let paperless-ngx "split" them into separate documents.

You need a barcode that represents a certain text (by default: `PATCHT`) that will signal paperless-ngx where a new document starts. The most robust solution is to use the following QR-Code:

![PATCHT QR Code](patcht.png)

> [!hint] Shrink QR-code before printing
> The QR code has a large resolution, but that doesn't mean you need to print it that large. Depending on the resolution of your scanner, 25% of the size should be fine.

Print-out the code - I recommend double-sided, so you can scan double-sided documents.

Add the following entries to `docker-compose.env`:
```
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_ENABLE_BARCODES=true
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_BARCODE_SCANNER=ZXING
```

When you scan documents, put the QR-code page(s) where you want to split the documents.
### Double-sided documents
If your scanner has an automatic document feeder (ADF) but does not support duplex-scanning, you can scan multiple documents on both sides and let paperless-ngx handle the merging.

Create the folder `double-sided` in your folder `consume` and add the following entries to `docker-compose.env`:
```
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_ENABLE_COLLATE_DOUBLE_SIDED=true
PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_RECURSIVE=true
```

The process is the following:
1. Scan one side of the documents into the folder `double-sided` (hint: Scan it into a different folder and check it, before moving it)
2. Wait for paperless-ngx to consume the document (once it disappears from the folder)
3. Turn the documents around (don't change the order) and scan them in to the folder `double-sided`
4. Once paperless consumes the second scan, the new document will appear.

> [!hint] Split double-sided documents
> You can combine the functionality with [document splitting](#document-splitting).

You can find more information on [paperless-ngx.com](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/advanced_usage/#collate).
### Auto-login

If you want to avoid typing user name and password every time you open paperless-ngx, you can configure automatic login.

> [!danger] paperless-ngx server
> Do not use this setting when running paperless-ngx on a server.

Add the following entry to `docker-compose.env`:
```
PAPERLESS_AUTO_LOGIN_USERNAME=<your username>
```

## Maintenance
Administrative tasks and advanced access.

### Backup and restore
Include the entire paperless-ngx folder in your backup strategy. The documents (subfolder: media) and the classification model (subfolder: data) are automatically included.

The database however is stored on a volume and needs to be extracted (before the backup). The easiest way to do so, is to use the [document exporter](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/administration/#exporter). The following command creates the backup `pgbackup.zip` in the folder `export`:
```
podman compose exec -T webserver document_exporter ../export --data-only -z -zn pgbackup
```
To restore the backup, extract the file `pgbackup.zip` into the folder `export` and run:
```
podman compose exec -T webserver document_importer ../export --data-only
```

### Database (DB) upgrade
New versions of PostgreSQL are not compatible with old data files. Therefore you need to backup, delete and restore the data when upgrading to a new version.

> [!caution] Simultaneous upgrade of paperless-ngx
> Do not upgrade paperless-ngx and the DB in the same step! A new version of paperless might change the DB structure - which could prevent restoring your data. It is recommended to update paperless-ngx **before** changing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. Update paperless-ngx (run `podman compose pull` and `podman compose up -d`)
2. Backup the database as described in [Backup and restore](#backup-and-restore)
3. Stop and remove the containers: `podman compose down`
4. Delete the volume containing the database (usually paperless_pgdata) in Podman
5. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file (version number after `docker.io/library/postgres`)
6. Update the image: `podman compose pull`
7. Start paperless-ngx: `podman compose up -d`
8. Restore the database as described in [Backup and restore](#backup-and-restore)

### Direct database access
If you used the `docker-compose.yml` file from my repository, it includes `pgadmin`. This makes it possible to directly access the paperless-ngx database:

1. Open http://localhost:8888
2. Enter username `admin@example.com` and password `admin`
3. Register the server (if not done yet):
	1. Right click on Servers: Register ‚û°Ô∏è Server...
	2. Enter a name of your choice and the following properties
		1. Name: `paperless-ngx`
		2. Host name/address: `db`
		3. Port: `5432`
		4. Maintenance database: `paperless`
		5. Username: `paperless`
		6. Password: `paperless`
4. Open the Server `paperless-ngx`
