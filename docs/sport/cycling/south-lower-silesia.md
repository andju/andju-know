## Day 0: Międzylesie
While staying in Prague is an option (*Café Imperial*[^1] and *Restaurace U Bansethů*[^2] are very good places to eat), you can also sleep (a bit longer) in this quiet, but charming village.

### Sights

- [Chateau Międzylesie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Mittelwalde)

### Food and accommodation
For dinner, the castle *Zamek Międzylesie*[^3] has an excellent restaurant. The venison dishes are particularly good.

While it also offers rooms to stay, they seem to be booked out constantly.

Another option to sleep in an historic monument is *Sukiennice Międzylesie*[^4] - which was once part of the cloth halls. On [polska-org.pl](https://polska-org.pl/515138,Miedzylesie,Zajazd_Sukiennice.html) you can find historic postcards depicting it. On [this one](https://polska-org.pl/8718979,foto.html?idEntity=515138) it is the first four windows of the large building on the left. Don't be put off by how run-down it looks outside: The rooms are modern and clean. Bicycle storage: Locked bicycle room next to the parking lot.

## Day 1: Międzylesie - Bardo
The route traverses remote roads and villages in the [Kłodzko Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%82odzko_Valley), set amidst the pretty Sudetes.

### Sights

- [Bystrzyca Kłodzka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystrzyca_K%C5%82odzka): Old town
- [Gorzanów Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorzan%C3%B3w_Castle)
- [Polanica-Zdrój](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polanica-Zdr%C3%B3j): Town center along the river and Spa Park
- [Kłodzko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%82odzko):
	- [Church of the Assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Assumption,_K%C5%82odzko)
	- Gothic bridge
	- [Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%82odzko_Fortress)

### Food and accommodation
There are no real breakfast options in Międzylesie, but *Lody z Międzylesia Rodzinna Manufaktura*[^5] offers good coffee. *Polskie Smaki*[^6] in Polanica-Zdrój offers polish classics in good quality.  *Kavosh*[^7] in Kłodzko offers solid coffee, cakes and ice cream. The restaurant of *Hotel Bardo*[^8] offers very good dinner.

*Hotel Bardo*[^8] is also a great option to stay overnight - making it worth the steep ascend right before the end. The apartment was spacious and clean. Bicycle storage: On the patio of the apartment (which is inside a "gated community").

### Alternative route
If you don't have a medical reason, you can skip the hospital in Polanica-Zdrój (it's on a hill but provides no view). Return e.g. at the Spa Park.

You can also skip Polanica-Zdrój completely, making it a more relaxed [route](https://bikerouter.de/#map=10/50.3249/16.7500/standard&lonlats=16.655906,50.143425;16.665123,50.145933;16.632442,50.183778;16.65199,50.29648;16.63296,50.351103;16.652382,50.438013;16.740648,50.5121&profile=trekking) (59 km | 434 hm | -110 hm).

## Day 2: Bardo - Świdnica
Reap the rewards of yesterdays hill climb and pick up speed on the first meters downhill. Afterwards the road follows mostly the [EuroVelo 9 - Baltic-Adriatic](https://en.eurovelo.com/ev9). Despite the big name, there are still almost no other cyclists.

> [!warning] Around Ząbkowice Śląskie
> Be careful when crossing the road 8 in the south!
> The way in the west is more of a "single trail" and should only be approached with a mountain bike. The alternative is to stay on Robotnicza.

After leaving Pieszyce, you will share the road with increased car traffic. It does not feel dangerous - but contrasts with the lonely roads travelled so far. Staying on the EuroVelo 9 after Lutomia Górna might be the better alternative.

### Sights

- [Ząbkowice Śląskie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C4%85bkowice_%C5%9Al%C4%85skie)

	- Old town
	- [Cathedral of St. Stanislaus and St. Wenceslaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Awidnica_Cathedral)

### Food and accommodation
The *Kavosh*[^9] in Ząbkowice Śląskie provides your caffeine fix. *Restauracja WARS*[^10] in Pieszyce is strongly recommended: Excellent polish classics for an even better price. The menu is written on a chalkboard and the staff doesn't speak English: So launch your favorite translation app and enjoy! There are plenty of Restaurants in Świdnica. *Restauracja Wieża*[^11] in  offers very good pizzas.

You can also stay in one of the spacious rooms of the former water tower in which *Restauracja Wieża*[^11] is located. Bicycle storage: Behind the locked entry door (after the restaurant was closed).

### Alternative route
You can follow a more relaxed [route](https://bikerouter.de/#map=11/50.6819/16.6354/standard&lonlats=16.740686,50.512146;16.674347,50.611792;16.581448,50.713485;16.511496,50.762731;16.486463,50.839494&profile=trekking) (49.5 km | 228 hm | -107 hm) that skips Ząbkowice Śląskie.

If you arrive in Świdnica and want to extend the route, you can cycle to [Książ Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ksi%C4%85%C5%BC_Castle) following [this route](https://bikerouter.de/#map=14/50.8540/16.3871/standard,Waymarked_Trails-Cycling&lonlats=16.486461,50.839487;16.335463,50.869329;16.293804,50.843152&profile=trekking) (19 km | 198 hm | +163 hm - return same way).

## Day 3: Wrocław
If you are still feeling sporty and have enough time left (there is still a whole city to see) you can [cycle](https://bikerouter.de/#map=11/50.9798/16.6951/standard&lonlats=16.486466,50.839498;16.503192,50.902062;16.777947,51.03941;16.798718,51.069595;17.037939,51.109387&profile=trekking) (65 km | 63 hm | -117 hm) to Wrocław. Everyone else takes the [train](https://kolejedolnoslaskie.pl/) (you can buy the tickets online).

### Sights
There are plenty of things to see: You can check [visitwroclaw.eu](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en) for an overview. Also the free walking tour from [Walkative!](https://freewalkingtour.com/wroclaw/old-town-wroclaw/) is highly recommended. Here are some of Wrocławs sights:

- [Rynek](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/rynek-we-wroclawiu-1)
- [Old Town Hall](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/ratusz-we-wroclawiu-1)
- [Market Hall](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/market-hall)
- [Piaskowy Bridge](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/piaskowy-bridge)
- [Ostrów Tumski](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/ostrow-tumski-1)
- [Viewpoint tower of Cathedral of St. John Baptist](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/wieza-widokowa-archikatedry-pw-sw-jana-chrzciciela-1)
- [Panorama of the Battle of Racławice](https://visitwroclaw.eu/en/place/panorama-raclawicka-wroclaw-1)

### Food
There are lots of restaurants for every taste and budget.

*Gniazdo*[^12] provides good breakfast options. You can find a few local restaurants in the market halls (near the main entrance), one of them being *Polskie Jadło*[^13]. You will need a translation app for the menu and order it at the counter - but you are rewarded with great value for a small price. On the opposite side of the market halls you will find a few small coffee shops. *Cafe Targowa*[^14] is one that I can personally recommend. To try as many different types of Pierogi as possible, check *Pierogarnia Stary Młyn*[^15].
