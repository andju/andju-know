# Garmin Epix Pro
When I looked for a digital sports watch one thing was important for me: I don't want to upload (sensitive) health and activity data into a cloud. I came across Garmin watches since they provide good quality and the ability to access their files via USB. Almost all data is stored in the [.fit format](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/overview/).

## .fit software
Software products that help managing and/or visualizing the data in .fit files.

### Single file
Open and visualize individual .fit files.

- [fitplotter](https://github.com/karaul/fitplotter)
- [GPXSee](https://www.gpxsee.org/)

### Management
Software to keep track of your activities.

- [Geo Activity Playground](https://martin-ueding.github.io/geo-activity-playground/): Promising solution to keep track of your activities. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it to work.
- [GoldenCheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org/): For statistic lovers. Shows various performance statistics, focussing on running and cycling.
- [Turtle Sport](https://turtlesport.sourceforge.io/EN/home.html): Visualize your various outdoor activities on a map. Seems to have problems showing heart rates. No new versions since 2017.
